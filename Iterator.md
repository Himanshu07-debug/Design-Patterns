**ITERATOR DESIGN PATTERN**

Iterator is a behavioral design pattern that lets you traverse
elements of a collection without exposing its underlying
representation (list, stack, tree, etc.).



**APPLICABILITY**

> Use the Iterator pattern when your collection has a complex data structure under the hood, but you want to hide its complexity from clients (either for convenience or security reasons).

> Use the Iterator when you want your code to be able to traverse different data structures or when types of these structures are unknown beforehand
(for this, You have to use generic in Iterator)

> Multiple Iterators or Parallel Iteration or Uniform Traversal Interface
