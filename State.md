**STATE**

> State is a behavioral design pattern that lets an object alter its behavior when its internal state changes. It appears as if the object changed its class


**NOTE**

> Same as **STRATEGY**, code also, Strategy makes these objects completely independent and unaware of each other. However, State doesnâ€™t restrict dependencies between concrete states, letting them alter the state of the context at will.
